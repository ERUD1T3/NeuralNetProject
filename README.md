### 1 - Write a computer program to classify letters from different fonts using Perceptron Learning. Use bipolar inputs and targets.

> See sources/ directory for the Perceptron Code

> link to the visual of the project https://p1-perceptron.herokuapp.com/


### 2 - After training with each value, test the ability of the net to classify noisy versions of training patterns. Try 5, 10, 15, 20 pixels wrong and the same levels of missing data (for the missing data use 0).


> For the forged dataset with 5, 10, 15, 20 missing data, see /sources/data/question2.json

> see docs/report.docx for the report

### 3 - Determine which letters are identified more easily than the others.

> The hardest letters to identify are J, D, K

> The easiest letters to identify are A, B, C, E
