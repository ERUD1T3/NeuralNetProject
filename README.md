<!-- report on the output -->


missing data = zero, 
wrong data = -1 when it should have been 1
add missing data for all font and add it to testing data
input -1 or 1 
testing -1, 0, 1

# 1 - Write a computer program to classify letters from different fonts using Perceptron Learning. Use bipolar inputs and targets.

> See sources directory


# 2 - After training with each value, test the ability of the net to classify noisy versions of training patterns. Try 5, 10, 15, 20 pixels wrong and the same levels of missing data (for the missing data use 0).

> When missing data, the network has trouble identifying the letter
> Wrong A



> Wrong B



> Wrong C




> Wrong D



> Wrong E



> Wrong J



> Wrong K

# 3 - Determine which letters are identified more easily than the others.

> The easiest letters to identify are A, B, C, E
> The hardest letters to identify are J, D, K
