Neural Network class project


# 1 - Write a computer program to classify letters from different fonts using Perceptron Learning. Use bipolar inputs and targets.

> See sources directory


# 2 - After training with each value, test the ability of the net to classify noisy versions of training patterns. Try 5, 10, 15, 20 pixels wrong and the same levels of missing data (for the missing data use 0).

> When missing data, the network has trouble identifying the letter

# 3 - Determine which letters are identified more easily than the others.

> From the least easy to the hardest,
